<publicity>
    #Defines whether a variable can be changed:#
    public          #a member (variable or method) can be accessed from any other class, regardless of the package it belongs to#
    private         #a member (variable or method) cannot be accessed from any other class#
<mutability>
    #Defines whether a member can be changed:#
    var             #short for variable#
    variable        #a member (variable or method) can be modified#
    val             #short for value#
    value           #a member (variable or method) can not be modified#
    alias           #adds an additional name for a member (variable or method)#
<ownership>
    #Defines how the member is scoped:#
    static          #a member (variable or method) belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of that class#
    scope           #a member (variable or method) belongs to the code block that it is contained in#
    inst            #short for instance#
    instance        #every instance of the class for each member (variable or method) with this tag has it's own instance of the member#
<concurrencyModifier>
    #Modifiers that affect behavior:#
    sync            #short for synchronized#
    synchronized    #tells the compiler/interpreter that a member (variable or method) is to be synchronized for multithreading#
    async           #short for asynchronous#
    asynchronous    #used for functions that creates a new thread for it's associated code to run on when created#
<format>
    #specifics tbd. In general #
<identifier>
    #@ before letters and number always indicates that a token is an identifier#
    #else any sequence of letters and numbers that begins with a letter is an identifier#
<argument>
    #(<label> <identifier>,<label> <identifier>,<label> <identifier>,...)#
    #A group of types enclosed in a set of circle braces and separated by commas#
    #the <identifier> parts can have three dots "..." added to the end to make it a vararg.#
    #The one rule here is that no vararg can be followed by a vararg of the same type#
    #or a <identifier> of the same type#
<function>
    #Any code enclosed in a block. A block is indicating using indents#
